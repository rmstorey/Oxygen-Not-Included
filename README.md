# Oxygen-Not-Included
Mods for Oxygen Not Included

This is a temporary update of the Extended Bridges mod by Chromiumboy. It will be taken down if / when the original mod is updated to be compatible with the June 25th Spaced Out mergedown build.

Note that my C# development skills are limited and this is at best a kludge for those who can't live without extended bridges. The buildings are accessible without researching, which is not ideal but will fix broken games.

This mod is not available to Subscribe in the workshop out of respect for Chromiumboy's work. To install, download the .dll and .yaml files to your %USERID%\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\Local\ folder and place in their own folder (I named mine ExtendedBridges-Local).
