Mods for Oxygen Not Included

This is a temporary update of the Extended Bridges mod by Chromiumboy. It will be taken down if / when the original mod is updated to be compatible with the June 25th Spaced Out mergedown build.

Note that my C# development skills are limited and this is at best a kludge for those who can't live without extended bridges. The buildings are accessible without researching, which is not ideal but will fix broken games.
